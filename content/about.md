I did my _Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)_, graduating debt-free under a [_research-focused scholarship_](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/premier-scholar-programmes/cn-yang-scholars-programme). I'm currently working as a _Data Analyst at [SingHealth](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/)_, Singapore's biggest healthcare cluster.

During my studies, I:

- designed a [_tray-return robot_](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ps9888-2021-g15/)
- co-authored a [_book chapter_](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/federated-learning-for-breast-cancer-classification/338985)
- recreated a [_life-sized model of my hall room in Minecraft during virtual orientation_](/OrientationHallRoomMinecraft.jpg)
- and... got a slipped disc. Pretty eventful I must say!

I also travelled places! Ahh, I miss the cool weather.

- Exchange Programme @ [_Georgia Tech, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸_](https://www.gatech.edu/)
- FYP @ [_Monash University, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º_](https://www.monash.edu/)

In my free time, you'll find me playing the guitar, making coffee, cooking steak or chasing frisbees. **Think we'd vibe? Ping me and let's find out!**
