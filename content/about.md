I did my **Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/)**, graduating debt-free under a [_research-focused scholarship_](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/premier-scholar-programmes/cn-yang-scholars-programme).

I'm currently working as a **Data Analyst at [SingHealth](https://www.singhealth.com.sg/)**, Singapore's biggest healthcare cluster.

During my undergraduate, I:

- designed a [_tray-return robot_](https://blogs.ntu.edu.sg/ps9888-2021-g15/)
- co-authored a [_book chapter_](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/federated-learning-for-breast-cancer-classification/338985)
- recreated a [_life-sized model of my hall room in Minecraft during virtual orientation_](/OrientationHallRoomMinecraft.jpg)
- got a _speeding ticket (it was not cheap)_
- and... got a slipped disc. :-(

Spent a lot of time travelling too! Ahh, I miss the cool weather.

- Overseas FYP @ [**AIM for Health Lab (formerly Monash Medical AI Group), Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º**](https://www.monash.edu/it/aimh-lab)

In my free time, you'll find me playing the guitar, [making coffee](/things/my_caffeine_addiction), cooking steak or chasing frisbees.
