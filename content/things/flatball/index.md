## Introduction

I threw the frisbee for the first time when I was 15. It all started because my classmates needed one more person to form a team.

I was so bad at it. It took me 1 year to throw it _relatively_ accurately (keyword: relatively).

10 years later, I'm the last one among them to still be playing.

## Competitions

I've competed in a range of tournaments, both local and overseas ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. Collected a couple of medals from some of them too! But also lost many matches in the process too!

> You win some. You lose some

I believe it is through competitions and extremely important games that you can see people's true characters. As this sport is self-refereed, all fouls and calls are very dependent on sportsmanship.

## Captaining Teams

I was given multiple opportunities to captain teams. Definitely stressful because it adds another layer to consider while trying to win games.

I had to learn how to segment feelings, objectives, and my own gameplay. I learnt to say (and not say) certain things; and also how there are correct ways to give criticism.

> There's more than one way to skin the cat

And having been under the leadership of other captains, I realised this isn't something that many people know about.

## Coaching Teams

Ever since I graduated from my JC (Junior College), I've been going back to coach. I have gone through at least 5 batches, seeing them come with zero experience to catching game-winning goals.

Coaching gave me a new appreciation for the sport. Being skillful doesn't necessarily mean that you can coach. Especially in a mixed sport, it is so important to know how to communicate.

In recent years, I have received words of appreciation from past batches, and how I've been an inspiration to some of them. And I am only glad that I've made such an impact to them.

Truth be told, I'm mediocre in the Singapore frisbee scene (IYKYK, story for another time). But to know that I have impacted people's lives - teaching them how to pick up a sport from nothing - that really hits different.

All I hope is that they continue to enjoy the sport even after JC, and be respectable sportsmen and sportswomen.

## Injuries

I've had my fair share of injuries:

- Left Ankle Sprain
- Right Ankle Sprain
- Slipped Disc
- Rotator Cuff Injury
- Wrist Sprains

And it sucks. Until you know it feels like to see your peers continue to play your favourite sport, while you sit on the sidelines, you will never be able to emphatise when someone gets injured.

My worst injury took me out for almost 1 year, and it was the worst time of my life. It was depressing. I had to (quite literally) roll out of bed, because I was not able to sit upright due to my back.

Never would I wish a slipped disc injury upon anyone else, not even my worst enemy.

## Frisbee in My Life

Ultimate frisbee is more than just a sport to me - it's a community, a source of joy, and a way to challenge myself physically and mentally. Itâ€™s taught me about teamwork, perseverance, and the importance of sportsmanship. Whether Iâ€™m playing, captaining, or coaching, frisbee continues to shape who I am and how I approach life.
