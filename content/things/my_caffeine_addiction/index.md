## Introduction

Every morning, I would buy my usual Kopi-C Siew Dai from the coffee shop.

> Kopi = Local coffee; C = Evaporated Milk; Siew Dai = Less sugar

After plenty of research (and a few bad shots), I finally pulled the trigger to purchase a $1,000 setup that delivers cafe-quality espresso at home.

I usually make a double-shot latte in the morning, but if I ever need another pick-me-up in the afternoon, I'll probably dial it down (no pun intended) and make a single-shot.

Have not been able to appreciate black coffee, but hopefully one day!

## Equipment

- **Espresso Machine:** [Breville Bambino Plus](https://www.breville.com/en-us/product/bes500)  
   Compact, fast, and beginner-friendly - great for consistent espresso at home.

  Love the auto-frother - saves me so much time and effort in the morning.

- **Grinder:** [DF54](https://cowpressocoffee.sg/products/df54)  
   Delivers precise and consistent grinds, essential for dialing in espresso.
- **Accessories:**
  - 2-in-1 distributor & tamper (not my favorite, but part of the kit)
  - 0.1g scale for accurate dosing
  - 54mm portafilter
  - [MHW-3BOMBER 54mm dosing funnel](https://mhw3bomber.com/products/mhw-3bomber-magnetic-coffee-dosing-ring)
  - Milk frothing pitcher (usually with Meiji milk)
  - WDT Distribution tool (basically a bunch of needles)
- **Beans:** Prefer darker roasts for a strong espresso kick in lattes (though I might experiment in the future).
- **Wishlist:** Planning to add a bottomless portafilter soon.

## Workflow

1. **Weigh and grind beans** (13.5g for single dose; 18g if I want the _omph_).
2. **Distribute, use WDT tool and tamp** evenly for consistent extraction.
3. **Pull the shot** (aim for 1:2 in-out ratio - 18g in, 36g out).
4. **Taste and adjust** grind size or dose as needed.

## Cost Breakdown

| Item             | Cost       |
| ---------------- | ---------- |
| Espresso Machine | $699       |
| Grinder          | $360       |
| Accessories      | $30        |
| **Total Setup**  | **$1,069** |

Assuming a typical latte costs $5 per cup, and each homemade cup costs $1.50 (beans, electricity, water):

- **Net savings per cup = $5 - $1.50 = $3.50**
- **Breakeven cups = $1,069 / $3.50 â‰ˆ 306 cups**

I'll need **306 cups** to break even, so about 10 months.

It'll be even lesser when I make for my loved ones kekek.

## Conclusion

Definitely a hefty amount to pay upfront, but everyone has enjoyed the drinks made by this setup.

And that brings me the most amount of happiness - to see my loved ones enjoy this machine together with me.

Maybe money **CAN** indeed buy happiness.
