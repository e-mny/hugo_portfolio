## The Beginning – Why This Project?

At the beginning, there was a problem that needed solving, and I found myself deeply intrigued by it. This chapter introduces the spark for the project and the motivation that drove me to embark on this journey.

- **The Idea**: The inspiration behind this project was to leverage machine learning to aid in early detection of breast cancer through mammogram image classification. It was both a real-world issue and a learning opportunity.
- **Why It Matters**: This project was significant because early detection of breast cancer can save lives. I had a personal connection as a family member had battled breast cancer, and I hoped to contribute to the field of healthcare technology.

## The Research – Diving Into the Unknown

This is the chapter where I started diving deep into the research and learning phase. I spent hours reading documentation, tutorials, and articles, but the road wasn’t always smooth.

- **Learning the Basics**: I relied on resources like TensorFlow and Keras documentation, online courses on Coursera, and research papers on medical image classification.
- **The Struggles**: The biggest roadblocks were understanding the complexities of medical images and the nuances of deep learning models.
- **Moment of Clarity**: A breakthrough moment was when I successfully implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) that started showing promising results on a small dataset.

## The Building – The Art of Creation

This chapter is all about the _doing_. It’s where the project took shape and everything started coming together.

- **Tech Stack Choices**: I chose Python for its simplicity and TensorFlow/Keras for their powerful deep learning capabilities. These tools were essential for handling the complexity of image classification.
- **Milestones**: Key milestones included data preprocessing, model training, and achieving a satisfactory accuracy rate.
- **Unexpected Challenges**: One difficulty was dealing with imbalanced datasets, which I overcame by using techniques like data augmentation and class weighting.
- **Personal Struggles**: There were moments of doubt, especially when the model's performance plateaued. I pushed through by continuously experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
