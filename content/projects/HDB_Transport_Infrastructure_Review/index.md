## Understanding Transport Disparities in HDB Towns

I was always passionate about the transport system. When I was young, I was so mesmerized by all the sketches of the future transportation system in Singapore - though it didn't occur to me that Singapore might sink if we were to do that.

One fine day, I was taking the MRT to meet my friends (or something). I was curious.

Are there HDB towns that are significantly underserved by public transport?

### The Research Questions

- Which areas have **insufficient transport infrastructure** compared to population density?
- How do **bus stops and MRT stations** align with **demand**?
- Are there **specific MRT phases** that should be accelerated?

### Interactive Overview: Public Transport Infrastructure

Explore the **overall transport density** across Singapore in the interactive map below:

---

## Analyzing Bus Stop Density

Bus stop distribution is **not uniform**, with some towns experiencing **notable shortages**.

### Key Findings

- Areas with **significant bus stop shortages**:
  1. **River Valley**
  2. **Punggol**
  3. **Sengkang**
  4. **Choa Chu Kang**
  5. **Newton**

### Interactive Map: Bus Stop Density Discrepancies

The heatmap below visualizes **bus stop coverage gaps**:

## MRT Station Density – Are Some Areas Underserved?

While the MRT network is extensive, **certain HDB towns have significantly fewer train stations** than needed.

### Top Areas with Train Stop Shortages

1. **Choa Chu Kang**
2. **Sengkang**
3. **Toa Payoh**
4. **Hougang**
5. **Woodlands**

### Interactive Map: Train Stop Density Discrepancies

Explore which areas require **more MRT stations**:

## Combined Transport Density Analysis

To assess the overall public transport accessibility, I calculated a **transport density discrepancy score**, which considers both **bus stops and MRT stations**.

### Interactive Map: Overall Public Transport Gaps

The following heatmap highlights areas with the **largest transport accessibility issues**:

## Future Transport Planning – What Should Be Prioritized?

Based on the findings, the following **MRT phases** should be prioritized for acceleration:

### Recommended MRT Expansions

- **Jurong Region Line (JRL) Phase 1 (2027)**
- **Cross Island Line (CRL) Phase 1 (2030)**
- **CRL Punggol Extension (2032)**

## Key Takeaways & Future Directions

### Final Thoughts

- Public transport infrastructure **varies significantly** across HDB towns.
- Certain MRT phases **should be accelerated** to address high-demand areas.
- **Interactive maps help visualize transport gaps effectively.**

### Next Steps

- Analyze **weekend vs. weekday transport accessibility**.
- Study **first-mile/last-mile connectivity issues**.
- Expand this study to **commercial and industrial zones**.
